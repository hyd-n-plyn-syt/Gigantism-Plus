# Gigantism Plus

## Description

This mod enhances greatly and enables for character creation, the physical defect Gigantism, retaining its base game functionality while introducing new mechanics. With this mod, Gigantism can be improved with mutation points as you level up, making it a unique defect that can be ranked up to offset its drawbacks and become useful.

## Updates

**If you were playing with Gigantism Plus before the most recent updates, the class of the mutation and several other things have changed, resulting in a harmless error on reload of your game. If the Defect is no longer present on your player, wish for: *mutation:GigantismPlus* to restore it as a defect. Unfortunately, you will lose whatever points you've put into it, but you can recompensate yourself with *stat:MP:amount* to set it back to where it was with the new changes. My apologies, but it needed to be done for future mod compatibility.**

## Features

- **Gigantic Fists:** A scaling natural weapon considered a cudgel and fully compatible with the cudgel skill line. These fists spawn on all your arms as hands, regardless of their number from mutations and chimeric arms. They act like standard fists but are gigantic weapons, providing an automatic +3 to damage from the start. They scale with the Gigantism defect, increasing from 1d3 damage by d1 every 3 ranks and 1d every 5 ranks. At rank 10, they deal 3d6 damage with no maximum penetration cap, allowing unlimited utilization of your strength. While powerful, they are still outclassed by gigantic-sized melee weapons, which you can now wield as if they were standard weapons. They also start at a -3 to hit, which raises by 1 every 2 ranks.
- **Gigantic Gear Only:** As per the standard game rules, you cannot wear or wield anything that lacks the gigantic mod, making gear hunting a challenge. You will, however, spawn with gigantic gear, despite your calling if you choose gigantic as a defect. The only items currently not included are the torches. You can also toggle the ability to tinker gigantic items, and the rarity of gigantic items spawning in the world in the options menu. All changes to the options require a new character and reload of the game. All natural weapons will also turn into gigantic weapons, gaining +3 damage.
- **Weight and Furniture Interaction:** With Gigantism, you weigh more and can break non-gigantic chairs, beds, and other furniture. Be mindful where you park your gigantic butt! You can also carry much more weight by default in the base game, which will be great for carrying around all your newly tinkered gigantic items.
- **Endgame Softlock Fixed:** In the base game, you are not allowed to enter small spaces as a gigantic creature, which essentially breaks an important endgame quest line. We've added in **Hunch** and **Straighten Up**, two new active abilities that toggle being hunched over, allowing you to squeeze into small spaces. Doing so will lower your QN, MV, and DV, but temporarily give you a bit more AV due to being in a more compressed position. Added compatibility with mods that add small spaces, like [Hearthpyre](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1683847053) (unaware of any others at the time, but should work great!).
- **Modular:** In the options menu, you can toggle several features of the mod. Tinkering the gigantic mod on to items, for yourself and for NPCs. The rarity of the gigantic mod on objects in the world. Allowing Rapid Advancement of the mutation as you would any other mutation. Toggling starting with gigantic gear if you're a gigantic character, and toggling on and off whether grenades are affected by this. Most of the options require a restart of the game, and a new character to take full effect.
